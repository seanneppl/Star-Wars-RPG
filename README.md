The star wars game is a simple role playing game built using html and javascript. On start, a player selects their character.  
The rest of the characters then become opponents. The player then selects an opponent, who moves to the defender position.  
The player then clicks the attack button and the two characters deal damage to each other. The players characters then 
increases by a random amount between 5 and 15. The characters continue attacking until either character is defeated.
If the oppenent is defeated the player selects another oppenent and continues until victorious and they are prompted to play
again. If they are defeated, the lose is lamented and they are prompted to continue their attrition.
